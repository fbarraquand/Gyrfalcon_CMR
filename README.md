# Gyrfalcon Mark-Recapture-Recovery modelling

Analyses of capture-recapture / resighting data from Iceland by F. Barraquand and O.K. Nielsen. We estimate survival rates for adults and juvenile, as well as effects of prey abundance and weather on juvenile survival. Final estimation is performed in Stan within the `MRR` folder, where we fit the Mark-Recapture-Recovery models. These combine recaptures from live and dead animals.
