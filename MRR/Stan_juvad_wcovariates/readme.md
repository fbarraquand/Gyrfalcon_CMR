The subfolders `unif_priors_wloo` and `changed_priors_wloo` present model selection code and results (both Bayes factors and loo) for the Uniform priors and Beta priors respectively. Those are the ones reported in the article. Removing the last year was needed for PSIS-LOO computation. The other codes compute Bayes factors too, but those seem to be less reliable (i.e. more sensitive to priors) with the last year included.
